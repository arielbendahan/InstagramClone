# InstagramClone

This project is a cloned version of Instagram. Here are some of the features:

- Home screen with posts from people you follow and stories at the top
- Discover page with posts
- Create post page
- Reels page with working videos
- Profile page
- Messages page

Most of these features were made just for design purposes, so you cannot create a post, view stories, comment on a post, etc...
